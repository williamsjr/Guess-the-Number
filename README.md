# Guess-the-Number
First randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is.
If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong 
(e.g. The number is too high or too low). 
If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.
